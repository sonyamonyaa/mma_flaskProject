<h5 class="w3-padding-16">Finds an MMA1 allocation for 3 agents using approximate leximin n-partition.</h5>
<p>
    MMA1 - Maximin aware by one item. If everyone gets more than you, at least it's by one item only.
</p>
<p>
    A leximin n-partition maximizes the minimum value over all possible n partitions,
    and if there is a tie it selects the one maximizing the second minimum value, and so on.
</p>
<p class="w3-text-grey">
    We use approximate version of leximin n-partition, where it maximizes the minimum sum value of a bundle.

    Alice, Bob, and Claire have some items they want to share. Each values the items differently.
    First, Claire splits the items to 3 bundles, using approximate leximin-n-partition,
    and lets Alice and Bob choose first. She keeps whatever is left after they decide.
    If there are any disputes among the two, Bob will split the bundles he prefers and
    allow Alice to select her bundle first.
