                1/2MMA - Maximin aware by half. Your bundle will always be worth at least half as much as the remaining items.

                A matching in a graph is a set of edges without common vertices. Maximum weight matching is a matching that maximises the weight of the edges.

                The envy reduction procedure finds who is envious of whom. If there's a cycle of envy,
                it swaps the bundles so each envious person gets the bundle they want.

    Alice, Bob, and Claire have some items they want to share. Each values the items differently.
    First, Claire splits the items to 3 bundles, using approximate leximin-n-partition,
    and lets Alice and Bob choose first. She keeps whatever is left after they decide.
    If there are any disputes among the two, Bob will split the bundles he prefers and
    allow Alice to select her bundle first.
